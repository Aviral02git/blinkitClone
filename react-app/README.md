# Blinkit Clone (React)

This folder contains a small Vite + React conversion of the static Blinkit-like UI with a working search input and basic button handlers.

To run locally:

1. Open a terminal and change to the `react-app` folder:

```bash
cd react-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on the port printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- Search filters product names and categories.
- Buttons show simple alerts (Login, My Cart, Shop Now, Order Now, Add to cart).
